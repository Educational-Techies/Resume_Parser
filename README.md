# Resume_Parser

This is a Resume Parser with GUI interface, It uses spacy library to do NLP processing. I have trained a model for over 4000 times over a dataset with 20000 enteries. The app uses the model to extract useful features from the CV of the candidate and rates them using a slider in the GUI. The extracted features are also listed for the recruiter to view and have a closer look.
